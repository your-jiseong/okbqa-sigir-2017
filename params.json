  "body": "## **Motivation and Description**\r\n\r\nThe huge and rapidly increasing amount of structured and unstructured data available on the Web makes it both possible and necessary to support users in finding relevant information. The trend moves more and more towards smart knowledge services that are able to find information, aggregate them, draw inferences, and present succinct answers without requiring the user to wade through a large number of documents. The novel avenues made possible by knowledge services are numerous and diverse, including ubiquitous information access (from smartphones, tablets, smart watches, etc.), barrier-free access to data (especially for the blind and disabled) and knowledge discovery. Over the last years, several challenges and calls for research projects have pointed out the dire need for pushing natural language interfaces. In this context, the importance of Semantic Web data as a premier knowledge source is rapidly increasing. But we are still far from having accurate natural language interfaces that allow handling complex information needs in a user-centric and highly performant manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of such interfaces requires the collaboration of a range of different fields, including natural language processing, information extraction, knowledge base construction and population, reasoning, and question answering.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis workshop aims to join four communities from the areas of question answering over structured knowledge bases, knowledge base construction for question answering, and NLP annotation for knowledge extraction, both from Europe and Asia: the Open Knowledge Base and Question Answering (OKBQA) community ([http://www.okbqa.org](http://www.okbqa.org)) rooted in the Exobrain project ([http://www.exobrain.kr](http://www.exobrain.kr)), the W3C community group for Natural Language Interfaces for the Web of Data ([https://www.w3.org/community/nli/](https://www.w3.org/community/nli/)), the Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD) community ([http://qald.sebastianwalter.org](http://qald.sebastianwalter.org)), and the NLP annotation and resources community from the Newsreader project ([http://www.newsreader-project.eu](http://www.newsreader-project.eu)).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this workshop is to join forces in the collaborative development of open frameworks for knowledge extraction and question answering, to share standards, and to foster the creation of an ecosystem of tools and benchmarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe workshop will therefore not only comprise short and long paper presentations but also a hands-on session on already existing frameworks, standards, and benchmarking campaigns, as well as a social meet-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Important Dates**\r\n* Submission deadline: 25 September, 2016 (23:59 Pacific Time)\r\n* Notification of acceptance: 16 October, 2016\r\n* Camera-ready versions of accepted papers: 30 October, 2016\r\n* Workshop date: 11 December, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Topics**\r\nSpecific topics include but are not limited to:\r\n* Natural Language Interface for Web of Data\r\n    * Browsing Linked Data\r\n    * Question Answering over Linked Data\r\n    * Benchmarking Natural Language Interfaces\r\n    * Term Matching and Entity Disambiguation\r\n    * SPARQL Query Pattern Generation\r\n    * Schema-agnostic Query Generation\r\n    * Discovery of Linked Data Sources\r\n    * Endpoint Profiling\r\n    * Dealing with Data and Schema Heterogeneity\r\n    * Providing Justifications of Answers and Conveying Trust\r\n    * Knowledge Base Design for Question Answering\r\n    * Language Resources and NLP Software for Question Answering\r\n    * Reasoning for Question Answering\r\n    * Natural Language Querying of RDF exposed as Linked Data\r\n    * Natural Language Querying of Web Services\r\n    * User Feedback and Interaction\r\n    * Dialogue Systems\r\n    * Personal Assistants\r\n* Knowledge Base Construction for Question Answering\r\n    * Entity-centered Knowledge Bases\r\n    * Event-centered Knowledge Bases\r\n    * Human Intervention of Knowledge with QA\r\n    * NLP Annotations for Knowledge Extraction and Machine Reading\r\n    * Gold Standard Data Sets and Quality Assessment\r\n    * Indexing and Mappings from Existing Sources (Structured, Semi-structured or Unstructured)\r\n* NLP Annotation Framework for Knowledge Base and Question Answering\r\n    * NLP annotation framework\r\n        * to represent the layers and their structure of language understanding in graph formats such as XML and RDF, including metadata and underlying ontologies\r\n    * NLP annotation knowledge base\r\n        * to access existing annotated NLP resources efficiently and effectively for further processing for knowledge base engineering and question answering\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Format**\r\n\r\nThe first half of the day will be comprised of long and short paper presentations on the workshop topics, opened by a keynote speaker with experience in linking computational linguistics and Semantic Web research. The second half of the day will be devoted to demo papers, panel discussions and hands-on sessions.\r\n \r\nWe expect participants from communities related to the following fields: NLP annotations and language resources, question answering, knowledge extraction and machine reading, and linked data and Semantic Web.\r\n \r\nIn addition, we plan a social meet-up on the evening after the workshop. It will be held in an informal setting and will be open for everyone, including presenters and interested participants from industry and other communities.\r\n \r\nThe workshop will also be coupled with an OKBQA platform for sharing the current status of the OKBQA question answering framework ([http://www.okbqa.org](http://www.okbqa.org)) as well as discussing ideas for future developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Organizers**\r\n\r\nAll organizers have been involved in a range of successful workshop series on the topics of this workshop, in particular:\r\n* Natural Language Interfaces for Web of Data ([NLIWoD 2014](http://2014.nliwod.org) and [2015](http://2015.nliwod.org)) in conjunction with ISWC 2014 and 2015\r\n* Question Answering over Linked Data ([QALD 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6](http://qald.sebastianwalter.org)) in conjunction with ESWC and CLEF.\r\n* OKBQA Hackathons ([OKBQA 1, 2, 3, 4](http://www.okbqa.org)) \r\n\r\n\r\n**Key-Sun Choi**  \r\nProfessor, KAIST, Korea  \r\nkschoi@kaist.ac.kr  \r\nHe received the Order of Service Merit on Hangeul (Korean alphabet) day on October 9, 2015 for his contribution to Korean language resource and processing and its globalization.
